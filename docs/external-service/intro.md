# Introduction

[`Flows Network`](https://docs.flows.network/) offers integrations with popular services like GitHub, OpenAI, Discord, Twitter, and more! This section provides an overview of the key services readily available on our platform.

While we strive to extend our core API coverage, the completeness varies among different services. We prioritize expanding our support for the most in-demand services, guided by community feedback. If there's a particular service you wish us to support, don't hesitate to reach out to us through [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ccZn9ZMfFf)  or submit a [Feature Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxdPmLnPVwvhuG5mzdkEsWUt1lMEYxdzb3BmDEzr2wumnTqA/viewform?usp=send_form) . We will respond as promptly as possible.

In line with the spirit of our platform—[Flows Network](https://docs.flows.network/) —applications deployed on our platform are able to leverage the network effect. This means all applications have the potential to interact with each other freely and combine different features and functionalities to achieve powerful results. For example, a bot can pull news of interest from HackerNews on an hourly basis, and then use OpenAI service to generate a succinct summary of each article. This way, you can receive timely news briefs in your Slack channel without being overwhelmed by copious amounts of text. In another scenario, a GitHub bot can monitor issues in your repository and use OpenAI services to gauge comment sentiment. If the sentiment surrounding an issue veers towards the negative, an alert can be swiftly sent to the Discord channel to notify the developers.
