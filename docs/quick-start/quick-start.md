# Quick start with WasmHaiku

This is a step-by-step guide for the users who want to create their first flow on WasmHaiku. In this chapter, you will learn how to create a flow in 5 mins.

> If you want to learn the basic concepts on WasmHaiku, please go to the [What is a Flow chapter].(what-is-a-flow.md) 

## Before you start

First, make sure you have signed up for an account on [WasmHaiku](https://wasmhaiku.com/). It's free!

It's strongly recommended to figure out the following questions. 
1. Which SaaS connector is the data source? (GitHub or GitLab)
2. Which kind of event want to monitor? (New GitHub issue or new merged PR)
3. Which SaaS connector is the target platform? (Slack or Discord)
4. which action do you want this flow to perform(Send a new channel message or direct message)

After you have an answer for the goal of a flow, it's easy to create your own flow. For example, let's say you want to get alerts on Slack if you have been assigned to a GitHub issue because the original GitHub notifications by email are too many to identify which one is urgent.


## Select the inbound connector: GitHub



## Select the outbound connector: Slack


## Compile and upload the flow function in Rust

## Enable the workflow
