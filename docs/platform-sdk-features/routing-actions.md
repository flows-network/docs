# Routing actions

`Flows Network` is a `code first` serverless platform with optional template based deployment for easy onboarding.

Go as far as `Flows Integration` libraries and platform-sdk's coverage, you can mash up any API or service, external or internal, and develop your own applications, especially, you can fire up multiple actions in one `Flows Function`. 

In [`issue-discord-or-slack`](https://github.com/flows-network/issue-discord-or-slack/), when bot receives a new issue event from GitHub, if the issue is good-first-issue, the bot sends message to your discord channel, if the issue is about bugs, the bot sends message to your slack channel to remind you for prompt response.
