# Troubleshooting

## I've pushed commits to my GitHub repo, but why isn't flows.network building my code automatically?

Please check the following items: 
- Have you disconnected the GitHub repo for your flow? If so, flows.network won't be able to listen to your GitHub repo anymore. 
- Have you changed the name of your GitHub repo? If you have, the listener for your repo won't work properly.
