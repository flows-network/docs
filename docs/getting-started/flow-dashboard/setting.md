## Rename your flow

Under the Flow name section, click on Edit to rename your flow and Save to save the changes.

## Freeze the flow

You can also importing a new GitHub repo after disconnecting, but the new function will replace the current flow.

## Change configurations

Under the Configuration section, you can delete or add configurations for your flow.

* Click the - to delete a piece of configuration.
* Click + to add a new one.

## Tags

Tags help you manage your flow. You can add different tags and re-use the existing tags here.

After that, you can search for your flow using `#tag_name` on the My Flows page.

## Suspend and delete the flow

Under the Danger Zone section, you can suspend and delete your flow.

Suspending a flow is revocable. It only works when the status of the flow is running. During the suspending period, the flow can't be triggered and hence there is no actions.

Deleting a flow is irrevocable. So you will need to double check before you delete a flow.
