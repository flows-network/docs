## What is Flows.network?

Flows.network is a platform that allows you to create **serverless workflows** through code.

## Key Features

- **Programmable**: You have full control of the application logic through code. You can persist states, perform complex data operations, and call external web services. Rust is supported, and JavaScript will follow.
- **Serverless**: You don't have to run your own webhook servers. Just create and upload a function to programmatically define your own workflows. The rest is handled automatically by Flows Network. The platform is fast, secure, and reliable.
- **Easy to develop**: Flows Network provides developer-friendly APIs for different SaaS integrations. There's no boilerplate code to authenticate and access SaaS APIs. You just need to authorize access to your SaaS accounts on the platform UI. You can automate across multiple SaaS in a single function.
- **How it works**: Flows Network provides easy-to-use APIs for different SaaS integrations. All you need to do is write the logic about triggers and actions in code. To deploy your flow function on Flows Network, you can import it from a GitHub Repo. Once imported, Flows Network will automatically handle the deployment process for you. You can authenticate and connect the required SaaS integrations like Slack with one click. This step is essential for integrating your tools and streamlining your workflow.
