We also released new versions of OpenAI integrations GitHub integrations, and flowsnet-platform-sdk.\\n\\n## Integration updates for developers\\n\\n1. Upgrade the `github-flows` Integration to the 0.5.1 version. The latest version includes a new feature called `GithubLogin::Default`, which automatically identifies the user\'s unique login account as their GitHub `login` account. This eliminates the need for users to manually input their personal GitHub account in the code. For an example, please click on the following link: https://github.com/flows-network/github-star-slack-messenger/pull/2/files.\\n2. Upgrade the openai-flows integration to the 0.7.1 version. Added  `let of = OpenAIFlows::new();`, which will find the OpenAI key named default.  If there is no key named default, the platform will search for other keys. This method eliminates the need for users to specify the key name in the code.  [Click the link to check out an example](https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-summary/blob/main/src/github-pr-summary.rs#L165).\\n3. Add log feature for the `flowsnet-platform-sdk` integration in the 0.1.4 version. With this feature, users can get more detailed and long-time logs for their flows. [Click the link to check out an example](https://github.com/DarumaDocker/github-func-test/blob/text-detection-lambda/src/lib.rs#L7).\\n\\n[Image: Image.jpg]\\n\\n\\n\\n## Introducing template  for users\\n\\nIn order to make the process of using flows.network easier for users, we have introduced pre-built flow templates that are popular. You can view these templates on the [templates](https://flows.network/templates) page. We are also working on adding more templates. \\nBy using a flow template, you only need to adjust certain settings for your bot and the SaaS integration required for the flow. Additionally, we will create a GitHub repository under your personal account to ensure that you have full control of the source code. Any updates you make to the repo will be automatically built by flows.network. \\n\\nAfter deploying a bot from the template, you will have a functioning bot and access to its source code. Let\'s take a look at how a Flow Template works.\\n\\n\\n### How to deploy a telegram bot from a flow template\\n\\nClick the template [ChatGPT Based Telegram Bot](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-chatgpt-bot) to start. Make sure you have signed in [flows.network](https://flows.network/).\\n\\nOn this page, you can see which template you\u2019re using and you will create a new GitHub repo for yourself.  As I mentioned before, to make sure you have the full control of the flow\u2019s code, flows.network will create a GitHub repo containing the template source code under your own GitHub org. Here you can change the repo name. The name by default is the name of the template you used. You can also choose your own repo public or not.\\n\\n[Image: Image.jpg]If you\u2019re ok with the default setting on this page, just click on Create and Build to create the GitHub repo and build the flow function.\\n\\nBuilding the function takes some time, meanwhile let\u2019s configure the SaaS integration required by the flow template meanwhile. Next you will go through the SaaS integrations that you need to configure.\\n\\n\\nWe also need to grant flows.netowork to access OpenAI. Click on Connect if it\u2019s your first time to connect OpenAI.  You will be directed to a new page. Here you need to copy and paste your OpenAI key on the API key zone. If you have connected OpenAI, just click on continue button to check out the flow details.\\n\\n\\n>If you already connected to OpenAI  and want to add a new one, click on +Add new authentication.\\n\\n\\n[Image: Image.jpg]\\n\\n For this `ChatGPT Telegram Bot`, we need to [add a telegram API token from the botfather](https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token). After you copy and paster the telegram API token in the configuration section, click on Deploy to deploy you flow.\\n\\nThat\u2019s it. You can see your flow is building. Once the status of your flow becomes `running`, you can go to the telegram to give the bot a try.\\n\\nThis is how a template works. With a template, deploying a bot is easy and  simple. Welcome to give it a try! Feel free to join our Discord server to stay updated or to request a template."},{"id":"build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/chatgpt-telegram-bot.md","source":"@site/blog/chatgpt-telegram-bot.md","title":"Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Telegram bot for ChatGPT","description":"ChatGPT has taken the world by storm.

However, it\'s desktop web browser UI is cumbersome and delivers a subpar conversation experience for users. Users already have messaging apps they love and use. We should bring ChatGPT to messaging apps and enable users to converse with ChatGPT anytime anywhere. \\n\\nTelegram is a popular messaging app that allows users to securely send messages, files, and media to individuals or groups. In this article, I will walk through how to build a ChatGPT bot on Telegram. I will further discuss how to customize your bot with your own prompts and how to access external services from the bot (ie similar to ChatGPT plugins in the desktop web UI). \\n\\n\\n> The bot is deployed on flows.network, [a serverless platform for automating SaaS workflows with AI workloads](https://flows.network/).\\n\\n\\n\\n## What is a telegram bot\\n\\nBefore we started, let\u2019s first understand how a telegram bot works. If you are familiar with Telegram bots, you can skip this part and go to the next part to [create a ChatGPT telegram bot](#create-a-general-chatgpt-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-3-minutes).\\n\\nEssentially, a Telegram bot is a software application that runs inside the Telegram app. It allows us to interact with it using text messages or commands. Telegram bots are built using APIs, which enable developers to create custom code to handle different types of messages and perform various actions.\\n\\nYou can use telegram bot to automate repetitive receptive tasks, such as send a welcome message to the new member. You can also integrate telegram with other SaaS. This is what exactly we are doing right now \u2014 integrate Telegram with ChatGPT. \\n\\n## Create a general ChatGPT Telegram bot from a flow template in 3 minutes\\n\\nWith ChatGPT\'s integration on Telegram, you can easily communicate with ChatGPT without the need to open an additional browser. This feature provides a convenient way to seek assistance from ChatGPT using Telegram\'s interface.\\n\\n\\n> Make sure you have signed up for an account for [flows.network](https://flows.network/).\\n\\n\\n1. Load [the ChatGPT based Telegram bot template](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-chatgpt-bot) and click on the Create and Build button. The template contains the source code for the bot itself. flows.networl will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later. We will use the code to combine awesome prompts with this telegram bot.\\n\\n![get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot](chatgpt-telegram-bot-01.png)\\n\\n2. **Give the bot your OpenAI API key.** Click the Connect button to add your OpenAI API key. If you have saved API keys in the past, you can skip this step and reuse these keys.\\n\\n![get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot](chatgpt-telegram-bot-02.png)\\n\\n3. **Configure the Telegram API token**. This is to connect the function with your bot. You can [get a telegram API token](https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token) from @botfather and paste the box here. Once you\'re done, the grey Deploy button will turn purple.\\n\\n![get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot](chatgpt-telegram-bot-03.png)\\n\\n\\nThat\u2019t it. After the function is ready and the status of flow is running, you can give your own ChatGPT Telegram bot a try. You can ask this ChatGPT Telegram bot to polish your english writing, being a writing tutor, and explain the code with different prompts.\\n\\n![get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot](chatgpt-telegram-bot-04.png)\\n\\n\\n## Advanced: Import awesome ChatGPT prompts to your telegram bot\\n\\nThe ChatGPT prompts marketplace is another hot topic with the fire of ChatGPT. Prompting is critical for getting more accurate and efficient output from the language model. This is particularly important in fields such as question-answering, language translation, and chatbot development, where the output quality is directly related to the accuracy of the prompts used. A well-written prompt is an essential tool for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of artificial intelligence systems in a wide range of applications. We have seen lots of ChatGPT prompts marketplace on the market, like the open-sourced [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) GitHub repo, [AwesomeChatGPT,](https://www.awesomegptprompts.com/) [FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com/) and so on.\\n\\nIn this section, I will show you how to add your favourite prompts to the ChatGPT Telegram bot you just built. The customized ChatGPT Telegram bot can be fine-tuned for a specific task. Here I use a prompt from AwesomeChatGPT.\\n\\n> I want you to act as an AI writing tutor. I will provide you with a student who needs help improving their writing and your task is to use artificial intelligence tools, such as natural language processing, to give the student feedback on how they can improve their composition. You should also use your rhetorical knowledge and experience about effective writing techniques in order to suggest ways that the student can better express their thoughts and ideas in written form.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we need to change the source code of the repo we created for you in the above step. You can find the GitHub repo address from the flow details page. \\n\\n ![get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot](chatgpt-telegram-bot-05.jpg)\\n \\nThen go to the `src` file of your source code repo and replace the existing ChatGPT prompt \u201cYou are a helpful assistant answering questions on Telegram\u201d with any of the ChatGPT prompt you need in [line 22](https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-gpt/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L22). \\n\\nBefore:\\n\\n```\\nlet system = \\"You are a helpful assistant answering questions on Telegram.\\\\n\\\\nIf someone greets you without asking a question, you can simply respond \\\\\\"Hello, I am your assistant on Telegram, built by the Second State team. I am ready for your question now!\\\\\\"\\";\\n```\\n\\nAfter:\\n\\n```\\nlet system = \\"I want you to act as an AI writing tutor. I will provide you with non-native english speakers who needs help improving their writing and your task is to use artificial intelligence tools, such as natural language processing, to give the student feedback on how they can improve their composition. You should also use your rhetorical knowledge and experience about effective writing techniques in order to suggest ways that the student can better express their thoughts and ideas in written form. \\\\n\\\\nIf someone greets you without asking a question, you can simply respond \\\\\\"Hello, I am your assistant on Telegram, built by the Second State team. I am ready for improving your English writing now!\\\\\\"\\";\\n```\\n\\n\\nAfter making the necessary changes, push them to the GitHub repository and flows.network will automatically build your function. Once the build is complete, you will receive a customized ChatGPT Telegram bot for your specific use, eliminating the need to prompt ChatGPT when you strat a new conversation.\\n\\n\\n## Access external web services\\n\\nThe flow function behind the bot has access to the web. That allows the Telegram to use the latest information and web services injunction with ChatGPT. In another word, you can build ChatGPT plugin-like functionalities into your own bot. [This example](https://github.com/flows-network/weather-lookup/blob/main/src/lib.rs) shows how to make HTTPS requests to an external web service to look up the current weather and parse the result from the response JSON data. \\n\\n\\n```\\nfn get_weather(city: &str) -> Result<ApiResult, String> {\\n    let mut writer = Vec::new();\\n    let api_key = std::env::var(\\"API_KEY\\").unwrap();\\n    let query_str = format!(\\n        \\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={api_key}\\"\\n    );\\n\\n    request::get(query_str, &mut writer)\\n        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())\\n        .and_then(|_| {\\n            serde_json::from_slice::<ApiResult>(&writer).map_err(|_| {\\n                \\"Please check if you\'ve typed the name of your city correctly\\".to_string()\\n            })\\n        })\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\nCombining ChatGPT with the web, your Telegram bot could be the conversational UI for complex applications. You can also call external web services to perform real world actions \u2014 for example, you could call the Twilio API to make a phone call based on ChatGPT outputs. \\n\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nWith flows.network, you can create a ChatGPT-powered Telegram bot in just three minutes. You can personalize your bot by making changes directly to the bot\u2019s source code. For example, you can  customize it with your favorite prompts or use external web services to provide additional context or to perform real world actions.\\n\\nWhat are you waiting for?

In this article, I will show you how to create a Discord channel bot that can send and receive messages from an external service to a Discord channel. To connect a Discord channel on flows.network, you need two parameters: `discord_channel_id` and `discord_token`. \\n\\n## How to get the Discord channel id\\n\\nLet\u2019s get started with channel id, which is much easier. Discord channel id is an 18-digit number. \\n\\n\\nEach channel has its own unique URL. A standard URL of a discord channel is made up of `discord.com/channels/numbers/discord_id`. All you need to do is to enter the channel where you want to deploy the bot and copy the last numbers of the URL. \\n\\n```\\nhttps://discord.com/channels/846973236280950824/846973236280950827\\n                                               |---channel id-----|\\n```\\n\\nThat\u2019s how we get the Discord channel id. You can use a Discord channel ID to indicate the channel from which the bot should exit.\\n\\n\\n## How to get the Discord bot token\\n\\n1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) You need to log in your Discord account first.\\n2. Click on the \\"New Application\\" button and give your bot a name.\\n3. Then, you will be redirected to the application details page. On the general information page, you can update your app icon, description, tags and other stuff.\\n4. Click on the \\"Bot\\" tab on the left-hand side of the page. In this page, we need to \\n    1. Click the Reset Token button to get the Discord bot token. Then save the token carefully, which we will use to build a flow on flows.network.\\n    2. Open the PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT.\\n5. Click on the \u201cOauth\\" tab on the left-hand side of the page and click on URL Generator.\\n    1. On the URL Generator page, select bot in the scope.\\n    2. Copy the bot URL from the GENERATED RRL in the bottom of this page. This URL is used to invite your bot to your Discord server after your flow is running successfully.\\n\\nAfter you get the Discord Chanel id and Discord bot token, go to flows.network to create a Discord bot, like the ChatGPT Discord server.\\n\\n\\n## Connect the channel id and Discord token with your bot\\n\\nThe easiest way to create a discord bot is to get started with a pre-built template. Let\u2019s take the [GitHub Issue Tracker template](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/github-issue-notification-tracker) as an example. After you complete the first step: create and build the flow, you\'ll be redirected to a page where you need to configure the Discord settings. As you can see from the image below, we need to fill in the Discord channel id and Discord bot token.\\n\\n\\n![](discord-flows.png)\\n\\n\\nWhen you finish all the steps and your flow turns running, you can invite the bot to your server by the bot URL you just got in the previous step."},{"id":"discord-chat-bot-guide","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/discord-chat-bot-guide","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/how-to-create-a-discord-chat-bot.md","source":"@site/blog/how-to-create-a-discord-chat-bot.md","title":"How to create a Discord chat bot","description":"A Discord chat bot is a bot user that can receive and respond to private messages, as well as channel messages that specifically mention or reply to the bot user.

We talked about [how to build a Telegram ChatGPT bot](https://flows.network/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network). In this guide, I will walk you through the process of building your own Telegram chatbot powered by [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude) in just three minutes using flows.network. You won\'t need to write any code or manage any servers. All you have to do is click a few buttons and provide some information.\\n\\nWith this Claude Telegram chatbot, you can:\\n\\n* Customize prompts to prompt Claude based on your needs\\n* Chat privately and in a public group\\n* Optionally set the maximum token length for your Claude model in the code\\n\\nBefore we start, let\u2019s learn some basic concepts of Claude and the Telegram bot.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45785633/250013894-5c24d37f-ef45-431b-bc9f-841a5d60925b.png)\\n\\n\\n### What is Claude\\n\\nClaude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It was designed using a technique called Constitutional AI, which trains language models like Claude through natural conversations. During these conversations, humans provide feedback to reinforce positive behavior and ensure safety and transparency.\\n\\nBy building your own Claude bot on Telegram, you contribute to the development of AI that prioritizes trustworthy and reliable interactions. Your bot\'s users will experience Claude as a helpful and honest AI partner, designed and trained to uphold those values above all else.\\n\\nIf you\'re new to Telegram bots, you can refer to our previous article which [introduced telegram bot](https://flows.network/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network#what-is-a-telegram-bot).\\n\\n\\n### Create a Claude Telegram Bot from a Flow Template in Three Steps\\n\\nThe first step is to load the pre-built template for [creating a Claude Telegram bot](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-claude) on your browser. Before you click on **Create and Build** button, you can review the three optional variables like the following image. Here I want to highlight the `system_prompt`  variables. This is for prompting Claude. You can type any prompts here.\\n\\n> The template contains [the source code for the bot itself](https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude). We will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45785633/250009300-c91edcc2-207f-44d0-a545-9a61d0c6db2f.png)\\n\\nOnce you have made your customizations, click the **Create and Build** button, and you will be directed to another page to configure the Claude integration. Next, you need to add your Claude API key. Click on Connect and enter your key.\\n\\n> If you don\u2019t have one, [apply here](https://claude.flows.network/alabulei1/access).\\n\\n![](https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude/assets/45785633/c5b42af7-58c0-4454-a6e2-22ecdd9d9d3e)\\n\\nThen, you need to add the Telegram token. You can follow this article to [get a Telegram token from @botfather](https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token). Once you\'re done, the grey **Deploy** button will turn purple. Click on the **Deploy** button in purple to complete the flow.\\n\\n![](https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude/assets/45785633/805f78b0-ca9b-476d-8ec2-1e5763c0edf5)\\nThat\'s it! Once the function is ready and the flow\'s status is \\"running,\\" you can test your own Claude Telegram bot. You can explore different roles for your bot, such as polishing English writing, serving as a writing tutor, or explaining code, by using different prompts.\\n\\nIf you\'d like to check out the source code, \\n\\n## Access External Web Service\\n\\nThe bot\'s flow function can access the web, enabling Telegram to utilize up-to-date information and web services in conjunction with Claude. In simpler terms, you have the ability to incorporate plugin-like functionalities of Claude into your own bot. \\n\\nFor example,  you can make HTTPS requests to an external web service to look up the current weather and parse the result from the response JSON data.\\n\\n```\\nfn get_weather(city: &str) -> Result<ApiResult, String> {\\n    let mut writer = Vec::new();\\n    let api_key = std::env::var(\\"API_KEY\\").unwrap();\\n    let query_str = format!(\\n        \\"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={api_key}\\"\\n    );\\n\\n    request::get(query_str, &mut writer)\\n        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())\\n        .and_then(|_| {\\n            serde_json::from_slice::<ApiResult>(&writer).map_err(|_| {\\n                \\"Please check if you\'ve typed the name of your city correctly\\".to_string()\\n            })\\n        })\\n}\\n```\\n\\nCombining Claude with the web, your Telegram bot will be just like a ChatGPT Plugin and leverage conversational UI for complex applications. Calling external web services provides more dynamic and real-world functionality.  For example, you can call the SendGrid API to send emails based on ChatGPT outputs.\\n\\n### References:\\n\\n* [Get a Telegram token for your bot](https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token)\\n* [Build a Telegram ChatGPT bot](https://flows.network/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network)"},{"id":"hacker-news-alert-slack","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hacker-news-alert-slack","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-06-26-hacker-news/hacker-news-slack.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-26-hacker-news/hacker-news-slack.md","title":"Never Miss a Beat: Receive Alerts for Hacker News Posts that You\'re Interested In","description":"If you\'re a hacker who frequents the popular news aggregation site Hacker News, you know how quickly posts can get lost in the shuffle.

With hundreds of new stories appearing each day, it can be tough to keep up with the topics that matter most to you. But what if there was a way to be notified anytime a post contained a specific keyword? That\'s where this article comes in. \\n\\nI will walk you through how to build a bot to automatically send Slack messages if a Hacker News post contains the keyword you are concerned with on [the flows.network platform](https://flows.network/). You can also extend this Hacker News bot to another SaaS platform that flows.network has integrated, like Notion, Discord, Telegram, Airtable, and so on.\\n\\n![Hacker News Alert](hacker-news-alert-01.jpg)\\n\\n## What is Hacker News\\n\\nBefore we start, let\u2019s learn more about Hacker News. If you\u2019re familiar with Hacker News, you can skip the next two sections. Hacker News is a social news website focused on technology and startups. It was created by Paul Graham\'s investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator, originally as a way for Y Combinator founders to share information and news.\\n\\nToday, Hacker News has evolved into a popular online community for entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts, and investors to share and discuss news, articles, and information related to technology, startups, and the wider tech industry. The website features a minimalist design that prioritizes original content and discussions over flashy graphics and ads.\\n\\nHacker News can be used as a valuable resource for people interested in keeping up with the latest news and trends in the tech industry. By participating in discussions and sharing content on Hacker News, individuals can gain exposure for their own projects, ideas, and businesses, as well as connect with other like-minded individuals who can offer valuable insights and feedback. \\n\\n![Hacker News Alert](hacker-news-alert-02.jpg)\\n\\n## Why we need a tool to  search and monitor the posts of Hacker News\\n\\n\\nAs an entrepreneur, tech enthusiast, or investor, staying on top of industry news and trends is crucial. However, manually scanning through every Hacker News post each day is time-consuming and impractical. However, with flows.network, it\u2019s possible to build a Hacker News Slack bot to search and monitor keywords that we value. The benefits of the bot are\\n\\n* Automatic: It will automatically send you the Hacker News posts via Slack messages at the scheduled time. No need to keep an eye on the Hacker News website.\\n* Scheduled and recorded: Schedule a time at your convenience to receive the Hacker News alerts. One of the reasons why we choose Slack is that Slack could help us save the past Hacker News posts.\\n* Flexible: You can customize the time you receive the Hacker News post. You also change another SaaS tool like Airtable as a receiver.\\n\\n\\n## How to create  a  Hacker News Slack bot, taking ChatGPT as an example\\n\\nNow that we\'ve established the need and benefits for a Hacker News Slack bot. let\'s take a closer look at how to build your own on flows.network. It\'s quite easy.  \\n\\nFor example, if a post on Hacker News contains ChatGPT, you will receive a message on a Slack channel. This message will include the post\u2019s Hacker News link and the source link of the post.\\n\\n> Make sure you have signed up for an account for [flows.network](https://flows.network/).\\n\\n1. [**Load the Hacker News alert bot template in flows.network**.](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/hackernews-alert) The template contains the source code for the bot itself. We will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later. \\n2. Configure the `KEYWORD`. Input the area that matters to you, like ChatGPT. Only support one keyword right now. After that, click on Create and Deploy. \\n3. **Authorize bot access to Slack.** The `slack_workspace` and `slack_channel` point to the target Slack channel where the bot will send you the ChatGPT-related Hacker News Post. Input your Slack workspace and channel here. Next, click on Connect to give the repo the necessary permissions in Slack.\\n\\n[Click here to see how to create a Hacker News Alert Slack bot in three steps.](https://github.com/flows-network/hackernews-alert)\\n\\nThat\u2019s it. After that, you will receive a message if the Hacker News Post contains ChatGPT every hour at the 50th minute. Then, you won\u2019t miss any Hacker News Posts related to ChatGPT.\\n\\n## What is the difference between Hacker News RSS and a Slack bot\\n\\nCompared with Hacker News RSS, one of the advantages of a Hacker News Slack bot is that the bot can be integrated into the SaaS tools you often use. But with Hacker News RSS, you need to install an extra tool to read the RSS feed.\\n\\nFurthermore, you can also integrate ChatGPT into this Slack bot and [ask ChatGPT to summarize all the Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/flows-network/hacker-news-alert-chatgpt-slack/tree/main/).\\n\\nIf you own a community on Discord, check out the Discord version to [monitor Hacker News posts containing the keyword you\'re interested in and ask ChatGPT to give a summary of each post](https://github.com/flows-network/hacker-news-alert-chatgpt-discord/tree/main/).\\n\\nGive it a try now!
