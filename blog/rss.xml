            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From April 3rd to April 7th, flows.network made the following updates:</p><ul><li><p>Added support for manually rebuilding flow functions: You can now find a "Rebuild" button next to the Deployment Log. While you generally won't need to rebuild your function, if you commit new changes to your code or re-authenticate your SaaS integrations, the flows.network platform will still automatically build the function again. This button has been added specifically to address unexpected problems. However, we hope no one need to clicks this button.</p></li><li><p>Upgrade OpenAI-flows integration to 0.4 and support <code>retry_time</code> function. This function can ask ChatGPT to retry to answer your question if ChatGPT can't reply to you previouly due to some network issues. For example, please check the <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-summary/blob/main/src/github-pr-summary.rs#L150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github-pr-summary</a> repo.</p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>flows.nework just released a new version last week. This version comes with Flow Template features that allows users onboard in 3 minutes. We also released new versions of OpenAI integrations GitHub integrations, and flowsnet-platform-sdk.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integration-updates-for-developers">Integration updates for developers<a class="hash-link" href="#integration-updates-for-developers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ol><li>Upgrade the <code>github-flows</code> Integration to the 0.5.1 version. The latest version includes a new feature called <code>GithubLogin::Default</code>, which automatically identifies the user's unique login account as their GitHub <code>login</code> account. This eliminates the need for users to manually input their personal GitHub account in the code. For an example, please click on the following link: <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/github-star-slack-messenger/pull/2/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/flows-network/github-star-slack-messenger/pull/2/files</a>.</li><li>Upgrade the openai-flows integration to the 0.7.1 version. Added  <code>let of = OpenAIFlows::new();</code>, which will find the OpenAI key named default.  If there is no key named default, the platform will search for other keys. This method eliminates the need for users to specify the key name in the code.  <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/github-pr-summary/blob/main/src/github-pr-summary.rs#L165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click the link to check out an example</a>.</li><li>Add log feature for the <code>flowsnet-platform-sdk</code> integration in the 0.1.4 version. With this feature, users can get more detailed and long-time logs for their flows. <a href="https://github.com/DarumaDocker/github-func-test/blob/text-detection-lambda/src/lib.rs#L7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click the link to check out an example</a>.</li></ol><p>[Image: Image.jpg]</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-template--for-users">Introducing template  for users<a class="hash-link" href="#introducing-template--for-users" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In order to make the process of using flows.network easier for users, we have introduced pre-built flow templates that are popular. You can view these templates on the <a href="https://flows.network/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">templates</a> page. We are also working on adding more templates.
By using a flow template, you only need to adjust certain settings for your bot and the SaaS integration required for the flow. Additionally, we will create a GitHub repository under your personal account to ensure that you have full control of the source code. Any updates you make to the repo will be automatically built by flows.network. </p><p>After deploying a bot from the template, you will have a functioning bot and access to its source code. Let's take a look at how a Flow Template works.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-deploy-a-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template">How to deploy a telegram bot from a flow template<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-deploy-a-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Click the template <a href="https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-chatgpt-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT Based Telegram Bot</a> to start. Make sure you have signed in <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flows.network</a>.</p><p>On this page, you can see which template you’re using and you will create a new GitHub repo for yourself.  As I mentioned before, to make sure you have the full control of the flow’s code, flows.network will create a GitHub repo containing the template source code under your own GitHub org. Here you can change the repo name. The name by default is the name of the template you used. You can also choose your own repo public or not.</p><p>[Image: Image.jpg]<!-- -->If you’re ok with the default setting on this page, just click on Create and Build to create the GitHub repo and build the flow function.</p><p>Building the function takes some time, meanwhile let’s configure the SaaS integration required by the flow template meanwhile. Next you will go through the SaaS integrations that you need to configure.</p><p>We also need to grant flows.netowork to access OpenAI. Click on Connect if it’s your first time to connect OpenAI.  You will be directed to a new page. Here you need to copy and paste your OpenAI key on the API key zone. If you have connected OpenAI, just click on continue button to check out the flow details.</p><blockquote><p>If you already connected to OpenAI  and want to add a new one, click on +Add new authentication.</p></blockquote><p>[Image: Image.jpg]</p><p> For this <code>ChatGPT Telegram Bot</code>, we need to <a href="https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a telegram API token from the botfather</a>. After you copy and paster the telegram API token in the configuration section, click on Deploy to deploy you flow.</p><p>That’s it. You can see your flow is building. Once the status of your flow becomes <code>running</code>, you can go to the telegram to give the bot a try.</p><p>This is how a template works. With a template, deploying a bot is easy and  simple. Welcome to give it a try! Feel free to join our Discord server to stay updated or to request a template.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. However, it's desktop web browser UI is cumbersome and delivers a subpar conversation experience for users. Users already have messaging apps they love and use. We should bring ChatGPT to messaging apps and enable users to converse with ChatGPT anytime anywhere. </p><p>Telegram is a popular messaging app that allows users to securely send messages, files, and media to individuals or groups. In this article, I will walk through how to build a ChatGPT bot on Telegram. I will further discuss how to customize your bot with your own prompts and how to access external services from the bot (ie similar to ChatGPT plugins in the desktop web UI). </p><blockquote><p>The bot is deployed on flows.network, <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a serverless platform for automating SaaS workflows with AI workloads</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-telegram-bot">What is a telegram bot<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-a-telegram-bot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Before we started, let’s first understand how a telegram bot works. If you are familiar with Telegram bots, you can skip this part and go to the next part to <a href="#create-a-general-chatgpt-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-3-minutes">create a ChatGPT telegram bot</a>.</p><p>Essentially, a Telegram bot is a software application that runs inside the Telegram app. It allows us to interact with it using text messages or commands. Telegram bots are built using APIs, which enable developers to create custom code to handle different types of messages and perform various actions.</p><p>You can use telegram bot to automate repetitive receptive tasks, such as send a welcome message to the new member. You can also integrate telegram with other SaaS. This is what exactly we are doing right now — integrate Telegram with ChatGPT. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-a-general-chatgpt-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-3-minutes">Create a general ChatGPT Telegram bot from a flow template in 3 minutes<a class="hash-link" href="#create-a-general-chatgpt-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-3-minutes" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>With ChatGPT's integration on Telegram, you can easily communicate with ChatGPT without the need to open an additional browser. This feature provides a convenient way to seek assistance from ChatGPT using Telegram's interface.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure you have signed up for an account for <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flows.network</a>.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Load <a href="https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-chatgpt-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ChatGPT based Telegram bot template</a> and click on the Create and Build button. The template contains the source code for the bot itself. flows.networl will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later. We will use the code to combine awesome prompts with this telegram bot.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot" src="/assets/images/chatgpt-telegram-bot-01-992906f01628bc51982b9c1dbc70d402.png" width="2338" height="1296" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Give the bot your OpenAI API key.</strong> Click the Connect button to add your OpenAI API key.

This is to connect the function with your bot. You can <a href="https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get a telegram API token</a> from @botfather and paste the box here. Once you're done, the grey Deploy button will turn purple.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot" src="/assets/images/chatgpt-telegram-bot-03-e96259bfc01099533a1f50d50f525272.png" width="1806" height="1232" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>That’t it. After the function is ready and the status of flow is running, you can give your own ChatGPT Telegram bot a try. You can ask this ChatGPT Telegram bot to polish your english writing, being a writing tutor, and explain the code with different prompts.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot" src="/assets/images/chatgpt-telegram-bot-04-1054c37b7a5e31e8e08cd1bdc7d08a8e.png" width="2314" height="668" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advanced-import-awesome-chatgpt-prompts-to-your-telegram-bot">Advanced: Import awesome ChatGPT prompts to your telegram bot<a class="hash-link" href="#advanced-import-awesome-chatgpt-prompts-to-your-telegram-bot" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The ChatGPT prompts marketplace is another hot topic with the fire of ChatGPT. Prompting is critical for getting more accurate and efficient output from the language model. This is particularly important in fields such as question-answering, language translation, and chatbot development, where the output quality is directly related to the accuracy of the prompts used. A well-written prompt is an essential tool for improving the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of artificial intelligence systems in a wide range of applications. We have seen lots of ChatGPT prompts marketplace on the market, like the open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome-chatgpt-prompts</a> GitHub repo, <a href="https://www.awesomegptprompts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AwesomeChatGPT,</a> <a href="https://flowgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlowGPT</a> and so on.</p><p>In this section, I will show you how to add your favourite prompts to the ChatGPT Telegram bot you just built. The customized ChatGPT Telegram bot can be fine-tuned for a specific task. Here I use a prompt from AwesomeChatGPT.</p><blockquote><p>I want you to act as an AI writing tutor. I will provide you with a student who needs help improving their writing and your task is to use artificial intelligence tools, such as natural language processing, to give the student feedback on how they can improve their composition. You should also use your rhetorical knowledge and experience about effective writing techniques in order to suggest ways that the student can better express their thoughts and ideas in written form.</p></blockquote><p>To achieve this goal, we need to change the source code of the repo we created for you in the above step. You can find the GitHub repo address from the flow details page. </p><p> <img loading="lazy" alt="get the source code for the ChatGPT Telegram bot" src="/assets/images/chatgpt-telegram-bot-05-4d45b2bfece61465a3319918ed3391c8.jpg" width="1134" height="392" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then go to the <code>src</code> file of your source code repo and replace the existing ChatGPT prompt “You are a helpful assistant answering questions on Telegram” with any of the ChatGPT prompt you need in <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-gpt/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">line 22</a>. </p><p>Before:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">let system = "You are a helpful assistant answering questions on Telegram.\n\nIf someone greets you without asking a question, you can simply respond \"Hello, I am your assistant on Telegram, built by the Second State team.

To connect a Discord channel on flows.network, you need two parameters: <code>discord_channel_id</code> and <code>discord_token</code>. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-get-the-discord-channel-id">How to get the Discord channel id<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-get-the-discord-channel-id" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Let’s get started with channel id, which is much easier. Discord channel id is an 18-digit number. </p><p>Each channel has its own unique URL. A standard URL of a discord channel is made up of <code>discord.com/channels/numbers/discord_id</code>. All you need to do is to enter the channel where you want to deploy the bot and copy the last numbers of the URL. </p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">https://discord.com/channels/846973236280950824/846973236280950827</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                                               |---channel id-----|</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>That’s how we get the Discord channel id.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To build Telegram bots or automate Telegram-related workflows on the flows.network platform, a Telegram bot token is necessary. flows.network supports <a href="https://flows.network/integration/Telegram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telegram integration</a>, which enables you to create Telegram bots with ease.</p><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get a bot token for Telegram. Then you can use this token to create your own telegram bot.</p><ol><li>Open Telegram on your device or web browser and search for the "BotFather" account <a href="https://t.me/BotFather" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BotFather</a>.</li><li>Start a chat with the BotFather and type "/newbot" to create a new bot. BotFather will ask for a name and username for your bot.</li><li>Choose a name and username for your bot. The name can be anything you like but the username must end with "bot". For example, the name can be "FlowsNetworkBot" and the username can be "@flowsnetworkbot".</li><li>If your chosen username is available, BotFather will provide you with a unique API token for your bot. You should copy and store this token carefully.</li><li>Once you have the API token, you can start building your Telegram bot on flows.network. Here is a template project to <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-gpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a ChatGPT-powered Telegram bot</a> on flows.network.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Note that the API token is a unique identifier for your bot, which allows you to send requests to the Telegram Bot API. Make sure to keep this token safe and secure, as anyone with access to this token can potentially control your bot.</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, getting a bot token for Telegram is a simple process that can be completed with BotFather's help. Once you have the token, you can start building your bot on flows.network.</p><p>Next step is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-gpt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">telegram-gpt</a> repo and folow the instrcutions to build your own chatgpt bot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flows.network</a> supports Anthropic's Claude and its newly issued Claude 2 (100k tokens supported). We talked about <a href="https://flows.network/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to build a Telegram ChatGPT bot</a>. In this guide, I will walk you through the process of building your own Telegram chatbot powered by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude</a> in just three minutes using flows.network. You won't need to write any code or manage any servers. All you have to do is click a few buttons and provide some information.</p><p>With this Claude Telegram chatbot, you can:</p><ul><li>Customize prompts to prompt Claude based on your needs</li><li>Chat privately and in a public group</li><li>Optionally set the maximum token length for your Claude model in the code</li></ul><p>Before we start, let’s learn some basic concepts of Claude and the Telegram bot.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45785633/250013894-5c24d37f-ef45-431b-bc9f-841a5d60925b.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-claude">What is Claude<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-claude" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Claude is an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It was designed using a technique called Constitutional AI, which trains language models like Claude through natural conversations. During these conversations, humans provide feedback to reinforce positive behavior and ensure safety and transparency.</p><p>By building your own Claude bot on Telegram, you contribute to the development of AI that prioritizes trustworthy and reliable interactions. Your bot's users will experience Claude as a helpful and honest AI partner, designed and trained to uphold those values above all else.</p><p>If you're new to Telegram bots, you can refer to our previous article which <a href="https://flows.network/blog/build-a-chatgpt-telegram-bot-with-flows-network#what-is-a-telegram-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced telegram bot</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="create-a-claude-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-three-steps">Create a Claude Telegram Bot from a Flow Template in Three Steps<a class="hash-link" href="#create-a-claude-telegram-bot-from-a-flow-template-in-three-steps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The first step is to load the pre-built template for <a href="https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/telegram-claude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a Claude Telegram bot</a> on your browser. Before you click on <strong>Create and Build</strong> button, you can review the three optional variables like the following image. Here I want to highlight the <code>system_prompt</code>  variables. This is for prompting Claude. You can type any prompts here.</p><blockquote><p>The template contains <a href="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the source code for the bot itself</a>. We will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45785633/250009300-c91edcc2-207f-44d0-a545-9a61d0c6db2f.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Once you have made your customizations, click the <strong>Create and Build</strong> button, and you will be directed to another page to configure the Claude integration. Next, you need to add your Claude API key. Click on Connect and enter your key.</p><blockquote><p>If you don’t have one, <a href="https://claude.flows.network/alabulei1/access" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apply here</a>.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude/assets/45785633/c5b42af7-58c0-4454-a6e2-22ecdd9d9d3e" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then, you need to add the Telegram token. You can follow this article to <a href="https://flows.network/blog/how-to-get-a-telegram-bot-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get a Telegram token from @botfather</a>. Once you're done, the grey <strong>Deploy</strong> button will turn purple. Click on the <strong>Deploy</strong> button in purple to complete the flow.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/flows-network/telegram-claude/assets/45785633/805f78b0-ca9b-476d-8ec2-1e5763c0edf5" class="img_ev3q">
That's it! Once the function is ready and the flow's status is "running," you can test your own Claude Telegram bot. You can explore different roles for your bot, such as polishing English writing, serving as a writing tutor, or explaining code, by using different prompts.</p><p>If you'd like to check out the source code, </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="access-external-web-service">Access External Web Service<a class="hash-link" href="#access-external-web-service" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The bot's flow function can access the web, enabling Telegram to utilize up-to-date information and web services in conjunction with Claude. In simpler terms, you have the ability to incorporate plugin-like functionalities of Claude into your own bot. </p><p>For example,  you can make HTTPS requests to an external web service to look up the current weather and parse the result from the response JSON data.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">fn get_weather(city: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;ApiResult, String&gt; {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    let mut writer = Vec::new();</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    let api_key = std::env::var("API_KEY").unwrap();</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    let query_str = format!(</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&amp;units=metric&amp;appid={api_key}"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    );</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    request::get(query_str, &amp;mut writer)</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        .and_then(|_| {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            serde_json::from_slice::&lt;ApiResult&gt;(&amp;writer).map_err(|_| {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                "Please check if you've typed the name of your city correctly".to_string()</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">            })</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">        })</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Combining Claude with the web, your Telegram bot will be just like a ChatGPT Plugin and leverage conversational UI for complex applications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you're a hacker who frequents the popular news aggregation site Hacker News, you know how quickly posts can get lost in the shuffle. With hundreds of new stories appearing each day, it can be tough to keep up with the topics that matter most to you. But what if there was a way to be notified anytime a post contained a specific keyword? That's where this article comes in. </p><p>I will walk you through how to build a bot to automatically send Slack messages if a Hacker News post contains the keyword you are concerned with on <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the flows.network platform</a>. You can also extend this Hacker News bot to another SaaS platform that flows.network has integrated, like Notion, Discord, Telegram, Airtable, and so on.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hacker News Alert" src="/assets/images/hacker-news-alert-01-852655fd62719115d3142fdd6c86d8c8.jpg" width="818" height="794" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-hacker-news">What is Hacker News<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-hacker-news" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Before we start, let’s learn more about Hacker News. If you’re familiar with Hacker News, you can skip the next two sections. Hacker News is a social news website focused on technology and startups. It was created by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator, originally as a way for Y Combinator founders to share information and news.</p><p>Today, Hacker News has evolved into a popular online community for entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts, and investors to share and discuss news, articles, and information related to technology, startups, and the wider tech industry. The website features a minimalist design that prioritizes original content and discussions over flashy graphics and ads.</p><p>Hacker News can be used as a valuable resource for people interested in keeping up with the latest news and trends in the tech industry. By participating in discussions and sharing content on Hacker News, individuals can gain exposure for their own projects, ideas, and businesses, as well as connect with other like-minded individuals who can offer valuable insights and feedback. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Hacker News Alert" src="/assets/images/hacker-news-alert-02-14b063d608421941fc8753e008cb6007.jpg" width="993" height="739" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-we-need-a-tool-to--search-and-monitor-the-posts-of-hacker-news">Why we need a tool to  search and monitor the posts of Hacker News<a class="hash-link" href="#why-we-need-a-tool-to--search-and-monitor-the-posts-of-hacker-news" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As an entrepreneur, tech enthusiast, or investor, staying on top of industry news and trends is crucial. However, manually scanning through every Hacker News post each day is time-consuming and impractical. However, with flows.network, it’s possible to build a Hacker News Slack bot to search and monitor keywords that we value. The benefits of the bot are</p><ul><li>Automatic: It will automatically send you the Hacker News posts via Slack messages at the scheduled time. No need to keep an eye on the Hacker News website.</li><li>Scheduled and recorded: Schedule a time at your convenience to receive the Hacker News alerts. One of the reasons why we choose Slack is that Slack could help us save the past Hacker News posts.</li><li>Flexible: You can customize the time you receive the Hacker News post. You also change another SaaS tool like Airtable as a receiver.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-create--a--hacker-news-slack-bot-taking-chatgpt-as-an-example">How to create  a  Hacker News Slack bot, taking ChatGPT as an example<a class="hash-link" href="#how-to-create--a--hacker-news-slack-bot-taking-chatgpt-as-an-example" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Now that we've established the need and benefits for a Hacker News Slack bot. let's take a closer look at how to build your own on flows.network. It's quite easy.  </p><p>For example, if a post on Hacker News contains ChatGPT, you will receive a message on a Slack channel. This message will include the post’s Hacker News link and the source link of the post.</p><blockquote><p>Make sure you have signed up for an account for <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flows.network</a>.</p></blockquote><ol><li><a href="https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/hackernews-alert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Load the Hacker News alert bot template in flows.network</strong>.</a> The template contains the source code for the bot itself. We will clone the source code to your own GitHub account so that you can modify and customize it later. </li><li>Configure the <code>KEYWORD</code>. Input the area that matters to you, like ChatGPT. Only support one keyword right now. After that, click on Create and Deploy. </li><li><strong>Authorize bot access to Slack.</strong> The <code>slack_workspace</code> and <code>slack_channel</code> point to the target Slack channel where the bot will send you the ChatGPT-related Hacker News Post.
